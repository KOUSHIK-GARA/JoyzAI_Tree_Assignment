# JoyzAi Angular Tree Assignment

## Overview

This Angular project demonstrates a **dynamic hierarchical tree structure** rendered with a recursive approach.  
Each node can be expanded/collapsed independently. The root node is detected automatically from the provided tree data. The UI is styled in a modern accordion/folder style for a clean, professional look.

- Arrow indicators (▲ for collapsed, ▼ for expanded) for better UX.
